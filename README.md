# Getir Interview Task List Assignment
Written by: Haluk Alper Karaevli


# Back-end
I have used express.js with mongodb as database and mongoose as connector.
The root of this repository is the backend code for the project.

# Front-end
I have used native react.js without redux, for datepicker and modal I used libraries which are:

- For datepicker: https://reactdatepicker.com/
- For modal: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/

You can see the front-end code in the folder named frontend-getir.
