# Getir Interview Task List Assignment
Written by: Haluk Alper Karaevli


# Back-end
I have used express.js with mongodb as database and mongoose as connector.
The root of this repository is the backend code for the project.

# Front-end
I have used native react.js without any add-ons like redux, except for datepicker and modal.
- For datepicker I have used: https://reactdatepicker.com/
- For modal I have used: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/

# Deployment
I have deployed the website on heroku.
